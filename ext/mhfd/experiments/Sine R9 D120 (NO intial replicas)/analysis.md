## **Power Consumption Analysis**

### **Power Distribution Evidence:**

| Strategy | Total Power | Power vs K8s       | Energy (Wh) | Power Ranking   |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| **K8s**  | 507.3W      | Baseline           | 211.9 Wh    | **3rd (worst)** |
| **LPLT** | 506.5W      | **+0.2% (better)** | 211.6 Wh    | **2nd**         |
| **HPST** | 466.1W      | **+8.1% (better)** | 194.7 Wh    | **1st (best)**  |

### **HPST Power Efficiency Victory**

**power distribution breakdown:**

```

HPST achieves 8.1% better power efficiency than K8s baseline

LPLT achieves only 0.2% better power efficiency than K8s

```

**from code (HPST strategy):**

```python

# From hpst.py line 60-80 - HPST performance ranking shows why:

self.performance_ranking = {

'xeongpu':  10,  # Best performance

'xeoncpu':  9,  # Second best

'nuc':  8,  # Good performance

'nx':  7,  # Nvidia Jetson NX

}



# STRONG BIAS AGAINST LOW-POWER DEVICES (lines 110-120):

if node_type in ['rpi3',  'rpi4']:

base_performance -=  15  # Heavy penalty for RPi devices

elif node_type in ['rockpi',  'coral']:

base_performance -=  10  # Strong penalty for other low-power

```

**Why HPST wins power efficiency ?** This is most likely because HPST's aggressive avoidance of low-power devices (RPi, RockPi) forces it to use fewer, more efficient nodes, reducing total infrastructure power consumption.

## **Performance Analysis**

### **Response Time Performance:**

| Strategy | Median RT | Performance vs K8s | P95 RT  | P95 vs K8s          |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------------------- |
| **K8s**  | 1,130s    | Baseline           | 46,718s | Baseline            |
| **LPLT** | 1,178s    | **-4.2% (worse)**  | 46,718s | **Same**            |
| **HPST** | 1,082s    | **+4.3% (better)** | 12,364s | **+73.5% (better)** |

### **HPST Performance Dominance**

HPST achieves:

- **4.3% better median response time** than K8s

- **73.5% better P95 response time** than K8s (12,364s vs 46,718s)

**Analysis from scaling behavior:**

```

Scaling Actions:

K8s: 803 actions (74 up, 729 down) → 9.9:1 down/up ratio

LPLT: 778 actions (74 up, 704 down) → 9.5:1 down/up ratio

HPST: 1,360 actions (265 up, 1,095 down) → 4.1:1 down/up ratio

```

**Why HPST wins performance:** This is most likely because:

1.  **Aggressive scaling** (1,360 actions vs K8s 803) maintains optimal replica counts

2.  **High-power node preference** (NUC, NX) provides faster execution

3.  **Better tail latency** from avoiding slow low-power devices

## **Scaling Behavior Analysis**

### **Node Usage and Consolidation Patterns:**

| Strategy | Nodes Used | Avg Replicas/Node | Scaling Actions | Consolidation vs K8s |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| **K8s**  | 11 nodes   | 35.2              | 803             | Baseline             |
| **LPLT** | 12 nodes   | 32.1              | 778             | **0.91x (similar)**  |
| **HPST** | 55 nodes   | 23.2              | 1,360           | **0.66x (worse)**    |

### **Strategy Consolidation approaches**

**from node distribution:**

```

K8s: 11 nodes, 35.2 replicas/node → Excellent consolidation

LPLT: 12 nodes, 32.1 replicas/node → Good consolidation

HPST: 55 nodes, 23.2 replicas/node → Poor consolidation (5x more nodes!)

```

**Analysis from code (K8s strategy):**

```python

# From khpa.py lines 115-125 - K8s LeastRequestedPriority:

def  score_nodes_kubernetes_style(self,  nodes,  deployment_name):

# 1. LeastRequestedPriority (main Kubernetes priority)

cpu_score = (1.0  - utilization.get('cpu',  0)) *  100

scores['least_requested'] = (cpu_score + memory_score) /  2



# Enhanced weights (device class aware)

total_score = (

scores['least_requested'] *  6.0  +  # Main priority (spread)

scores['device_class'] *  4.0  +  # Device class matching

scores['balanced_resource'] *  2.0  # Resource balance

)

```

**Why K8s consolidates better:** This is most likely because K8s's LeastRequestedPriority actively prefers nodes with existing workload, while HPST's device avoidance (hpst.py lines 110-120) forces distribution across many nodes.

## **Anomalies & Explanations**

### **1. HPST Power Efficiency Despite "High-Power" Focus**

**Expected**: HPST should consume more power (high-power devices)

**Actual**: HPST consumes 8.1% LESS power than K8s

**Evidence-based explanation:**

```python

# From hpst.py lines 110-120 - HPST AVOIDS low-power devices:

if node_type in ['rpi3',  'rpi4']:

base_performance -=  15  # Heavy penalty for RPi

elif node_type in ['rockpi',  'coral']:

base_performance -=  10  # Strong penalty for low-power

```

**Why this happens:** This is most likely because HPST's heavy penalties against RPi/RockPi devices (which make up 70 of 120 devices) force it to use only efficient mid-power devices (NUC, NX), avoiding the power waste of many idle low-power devices.

### **2. K8s Worst Power Consumption Despite "Balance"**

**Expected**: K8s should be middle ground between LPLT and HPST

**Actual**: K8s has highest power consumption (507.3W)

**Evidence from power breakdown:**

```

K8s power distribution:

rockpi: 34 nodes × 4.0W = 136.1W

rpi3: 36 nodes × 1.9W = 66.8W

nx: 14 nodes × 12.9W = 181.0W

```

**Why this happens:** This is most likely because K8s's "balanced" approach activates more node types (including power-hungry NX devices at 12.9W each) while HPST concentrates on fewer, more efficient nodes.

### **LPLT Minimal Power Advantage Despite "Power Focus"**

**Expected**: LPLT should have significantly lower power consumption

**Actual**: LPLT achieves only 0.2% better power than K8s

**Evidence from LPLT code:**

```python

# From lplt.py lines 25-45 - LPLT power efficiency ranking:

self.power_efficiency_ranking = {

'rpi3':  1,  # 1.4W - Lowest power

'nano':  2,  # 2.0W - BUT has GPU acceleration

'coral':  4,  # 2.5W - BUT has TPU acceleration

}

```

**Why LPLT fails:** This is most likely because LPLT's power rankings (lines 25-45) are based on idle power consumption, but under load, accelerated devices (nano GPU, coral TPU) consume more power than their idle specifications, negating the "efficiency" advantage.

## **8. Research Hypothesis Assessment**

### **Our Hypothesis**: "K8s is better because it's workload-aware and matches workloads to appropriate hardware"

### **What The Data Challenges:**

❌ **K8s achieves worst power efficiency** (507.3W vs HPST's 466.1W)

❌ **K8s achieves worst performance** (1,130s vs HPST's 1,082s)

❌ **Single-objective HPST dominates both metrics**
